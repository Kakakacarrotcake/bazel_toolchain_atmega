			<h2>
				<span class="s1"><b>Introduction</b></span>
			</h2>
			<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This is a
					general update
					to the Microchip MPLAB<sup>®</sup> XC
					Network Server. This version updates RLM server to 15.1(BL2) .</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>
						<span class="s1"><b>Previous Versions</b></span>
					</h3>
					<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The previous MPLAB XC
							Network Server was version
							3.10 which was
							based on RLM 15.0(BL1) .</span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>
						<span class="s1"><b>System Requirements</b></span>
					</h3>
					<p class="p5"><span class="s1">MPLAB XC Network Server is available for a variety of 64-bit
							operating systems, including Microsoft® Windows® 10 and above;
							Ubuntu® 18.04 and above; or Mac OS® X 13.2 and above.</span></p>
					<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The
							server may also run on various other operating systems including Windows
							Server, Linux distributions, such as Oracle® Enterprise Linux® and Red Hat® Enterprise Linux
							as well
							as older versions of supported operating systems. However, XC License server
							is not evaluated on these operating systems.</span></p>
					<p class="p5"><span class="s1">MPLAB
							XC Network License Server can be run on Virtual Machines of the supported OS
							using a virtual machine license for network licenses (<a
								href="https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/SW006021-VM"><span
									class="s4">SW006021-VM</span></a>). 32-bit versions of MPLAB XC Network
							Server are discontinued starting from version 3.00.</span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>
						<span class="s1"><b> Installation</b></span>
					</h3>
					<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Run the .exe (Windows), .run (Linux) or .app (OS X) server installer
							application (for example, XCNetLicServer-3.20-windows.exe) and follow the directions on the
							screen. Using the default installation directory is recommended.</span></p>
					<p class="p5"><span class="s1">If you are using Linux, you must install the compiler using a
							terminal and from a root account. Install using a Mac OS X account with administrator
							privileges.</span></p>
					<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Full information on installation and operation of the MPLAB XC
							License Server is covered in the newest version of the XC License Server Manual
							(DS5002334).</span></p>

			<h2>
				<span class="s1"><b>What’s New</b></span>
			</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>
						<span class="s1"><b> Version 3.20</b></span>
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Updated
										to the latest version of RLM - </b>MPLAB XC Network Server v3.20 is
									based on the Reprise License Manager version 15.1(BL2). This upgrade
									provides various enhancements and bug fixes made by Reprise to RLM
									license server.</span></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>RLM server now requires users
										to log
										in for additional security. </b></span></p>
							<ul>
								<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>
											A default
											rlm.pw file is created with an admin user : </b>The login capability is
										provided
										via
										the RLM
										password file, named rlm.pw. Beginning in RLM
										v15.1, if this file doesn’t exist, RLM will create it automatically at startup
										with
										a
										default
										<i>'admin:admin:all'</i> account. Reprise Software recommends that you protect
										access to this
										file so
										that
										ordinary users can't write it. The RLM password file, as well as the directory
										which
										contains
										it,
										must be read-write to the RLM process.
										The RLM password file has one line for each user, formatted as follows:
										<i>'username:password:list-of-permissions'</i>.
										The username must not contain a ':' character.
										If the password field is blank, then the user can log in without supplying a
										password.
										When
										adding
										new users, you must set a password within 10 minutes or the server will
										automatically
										shut down
										if it is running. To change their password, select the "Change Password" menu
										item
										once
										logged
										in
										as that user. The password field is an encrypted hash of the actual password
										(similar to
										the
										Unix
										password file).</span></p>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Adding New Users: </b> Beginning in RLM v15.1, a
										default user with
										the
										username
										admin and password admin is created
										if rlm.pw does not already exist.<br /><br />
										To add a new user:<br /><br />
										1. Open rlm.pw (located in the RLM binary directory)<br />
										2. Add a new user with a blank
										password and
										desired permissions:
										johndoe::status<br />
										3. Log in to the web server as this new user and click Change Password to set a
										password
										for the user.<br /><br />
										<b>Note:</b> If there are any users without passwords and/or the admin password
										is still
										the
										default, for longer than 10 minutes the server will shut down automatically.

									</span></p>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><span class="s1"><b>RLM web server now supports
									HTTPS.
								</b></span>
							<ul><br />To enable HTTPS in the web server you should use the two new startup options,
								-sslcert and
								-sslpriv to point to your SSL certificate and SSL private key. E.g.:
								<ul><br />% ./rlm -sslcert /path/to/cert.pem -sslpriv /path/to/privkey.pem</ul><br />
							</ul>
							<ul>Now you can access your web server by typing https://your-server-host:5054 (be sure to
								include the https:// if you are not automatically redirecting the url via other means).
								If you are running your server as root/administrator, it is possible to set your web
								server to run on port 443 (the default HTTPS port) by running the following:
								<ul><br />% ./rlm -sslcert /path/to/cert.pem -sslpriv /path/to/privkey.pem -ws 443 </ul>
								<br />
							</ul>

							<ul>While running
								on port
								443 and pointing at valid SSL certificate and private key, your browser
								should automatically redirect to https:// without needing to type it explicitly. i.e.,
								typing
								yourserver-host/ should take you to https://your-server-host:443.</ul>

							<ul><br />
								<b>Note:</b> If you prefer to generate your own self-signed certificates, your traffic
								to the
								web
								server will
								still be encrypted, but your browser will likely display a warning before you can get to
								the web
								server. Self-signed certificates cannot be generated with a password to use the web
								server.
							</ul>
