# Microchip PIC12F529T39A Configuration Word Definitions

# File Syntax:
# Each configuration register is given as:
# 
#     CWORD:<address>:<mask>:<default value>[:<name>[,<alias list>]]
# 
# for each CWORD the configuration settings are listed as
# 
#     CSETTING:<mask>:<name>[,<alias list>]:<description>
# 
# lastly for each CSETTING all possible values are listed as
# 
#     CVALUE:<value>:<name>[,<alias list>]:<description>
# 
# All numerical values are given in unqualified hex.  In terms of
# #pragma config, note the following correspondence:
# 
#    #pragma config CSETTING<name> = CVALUE<name>
# 
# The compiler may also emit a message when it detects certain programming.
# This behaviour is defined by the following record
# 
#     CMSG:<CSETTING name>=<CVALUE name>[,...]:<message number>
# 
# If the compiler encounters the given programming then it will emit the
# with the corresponding numnber.  Note that these records must appear last
# in the file.
# 
# Comments are also permitted.  Any line beginning with a '#'
# character will be treated as a comment.
