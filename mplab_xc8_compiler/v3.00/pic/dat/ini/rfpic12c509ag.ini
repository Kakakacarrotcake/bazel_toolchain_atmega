#	PICC.INI
#	This file defines the memory sizes and organization
#	of a PIC10/12/16 device
#
#	All values are in hexadecimal unless otherwise stated.
#
#	Fields used are:
#
#	ARCH=<processor_architecture>
#			PIC12, PIC14 or PIC16, corresponding to baseline,
#			midrange and high end respectively
#	PROCID=<id>
#			Microchip processor identifier. This corresponds
#			to the processor field in Microchip COFF output.
#	ROMSIZE=<size_of_rom>
#			Size of program memory (words) in hex
#	BANKS=<num_banks>
#			Number of data memory banks used (for the
#			midrange, this will always be at least 2)
#	RAMBANK=<range_start>,<range_end>
#			This field may appear multiple times and
#			specifies a RAM bank memory range. e.g. A0,BF
#	COMMON=<range_start>,<range_end>
#			Specifies an area of RAM that is mirrored in all
#			banks, i.e. is accessible regardless of RPn settings.
#	ICD1RAM=<range_start>,<range_end>
#			Specifies an area of RAM that is used by
#			MPLAB-ICD
#	ICD2RAM=<range_start>,<range_end>
#			Specifies an area of RAM that is used by
#			MPLAB-ICD2
#	ICD3RAM=<range_start>,<range_end>
#			Specifies an area of RAM that is used by
#			MPLAB-ICD3 and REAL-ICE
#	ICD1ROM=<range_start>,<range_end>
#			Specifies an area of ROM that is used by
#			MPLAB-ICD
#	ICD2ROM=<range_start>,<range_end>
#			Specifies an area of ROM that is used by
#			MPLAB-ICD2
#	ICD3ROM=<range_start>,<range_end>
#			Specifies an area of ROM that is used by
#			MPLAB-ICD3 and REAL-ICE
#	DATABANK=<bank>
#			Identifies which bank the EEDATA/PMDATA register is found.
#			Used for library selection.
#
#	FLASHTYPE=<string>
#			Indicates if and how this midrange processor is capable of reading
#			and how a device can write to its own program memory.
#			READ - Read only
#			READWRITE_1 - Writes one word at a time, erasure is automatic
#			READWRITE_A - Writes done in blocks of words, block erasure automatic
#			READWRITE_B - Writes done in blocks, erasure is separate step
#
#	FLASH_READ=<size>
#			The number of words read in a flash-read operation. Default is zero.
#
#	FLASH_WRITE=<size>
#			The number of words in flash writing block. Default is zero.
#
#	FLASH_ERASE=<size>
#			The number of words in a flash-erase block. Default is FLASH_WRITE size.
#
#	EEPROM=<range_start-range_end>
#			Identifies the range (bytes) of EEPROM available to this device
#
#	FLASHDATA=<range_start-range_end>
#			Defines the range of flash memory used to access EEPROM data
#
#	OSCCAL=<address>
#			The address where the OSCCAL sfr is located.
#
#	OSCCON=<address>
#			The address where the OSCCON sfr is located.
#
#	OSCHOW=<string>
#			How does the device calibrate its oscillator?
#			RETLW - The device's oscillator calibration constant is stored at the top
#			of program memory in a RETLW instruction, the compiler can assign this
#			to the OSCCAL sfr which is located at OSCCAL.
#			CALWORD - The device stores the oscillator constant in a calibration
#			word located in flash program memory.  The word is read from program
#			memory and assigned to OSCCAL.  The compiler does not perform this
#			operation.  It must be done by the user's program.
#
#	CONFIG=<range_start-range_end>
#			Define a new address range for the configuration register region if
#			the address range differs from the traditional range for its
#			architecture type.
#
#	IDLOC=<range_start-range_end>
#			Define a new address range for the user ID location region if
#			the address range differs from the traditional range for its
#			architecture type.
#
#	STACKDEPTH=<limit>
#			This is used set the maximum stack level depth for a processor. If not specified,
#			the default setting will be 2 for baseline PICs, 8 for midrange PICs and 16 for
#			high-end PICs and enhanced mid-range PICs.
#
#	VOLSFRS=<range_start>-<range_end>,...
#			Instructions generated by the compiler that access SFRs in the given memory
#			ranges will won't be optimized by the assembly optimizer
#
#	BANKSIZE=<size>
#			Maximum number of bytes in a RAM bank.
#
#	PAGESIZE=<size>
#			Maximum number of words in a program memory page.
#
#	LINEARBASE=<addr>
#			Base address of the virtual linear data memory, exclusive to enhanced mid-range devices.
#
#   PCBITS=<number of bits>
#           How many implemented bits are there in the PC?
#
#   EEADRBITS=<number of bits>
#           How many bits are available to address data EEPROM, if any.
#
#   BANKSELBITS=<number of bits>
#           Number of bits available for bank-selection.
#
#   EEPROMINT=<EEREG_INT|NVMREG_INT>
#   		Which register interface is used to access the device's EEPROM, if any.
#
#	SFR=<name>,<address>,<bit-width>
#			Describes a SFR of the device.  The address is in hexadecimal, and the bit-width decimal.
#			SFRs are sorted in order of address, and then by bit-width in descending order.  If an SFR duplicates
#			an address, then that SFR is an alias of the first with that address.  An SFR that has a bit-width
#			greater than the next, but the next also shares the same address, then that SFR is a joined SFR
#			of those that follow, but limited by its bit-width.
#
#	SFRFLD=<name>,<address>,<bit-position>,<bit-width>
#			Describes a SFR bit-field of the device.  The address is in hexadecimal, and the bit-width and
#			bit-position are decimal. SFRFLDs are sorted in order of address.
#
#	CONFIGPROG=<num_regs>,<delta>,<alignment>
#	IDLOCPROG=<num_regs>,<delta>,<alignment>
#			These describe the programming characteristics of configuration and user id memory.
#			Where,
#			<num_regs> = the number of registers (equivalent to a CWORD in CFGDATA files) per programming unit.
#			<delta> = the address delta between contiguous registers, i.e. the addresses of a CWORD.
#			<alignment> = the address alignment of programming units, where the address is that of the first CWORD
#							in the programming unit.
#
